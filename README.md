# Optimal Life-Cycle Adaptation of Coastal Infrastructure under Climate Change
Climate change adaptation is often addressed with static policies that ignore future climate uncertainties. This work develops a climate change adaptation framework using stochastic-control methodologies, offering optimal solutions that address model uncertainty, social costs of carbon, and a wide variety of adaptation actions.

# Steps to generate adaptation policies for coastal applications
