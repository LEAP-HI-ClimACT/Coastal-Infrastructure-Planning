# Optimal Life-Cycle Adaptation of Coastal Infrastructure under Climate Change
This repository includes the codes used in the paper: "Optimal Life-Cycle Adaptation of Coastal Infrastructure under Climate Change".

**TLDR**: Climate change adaptation is often addressed with static policies that ignore future climate uncertainties. This work develops a climate change adaptation framework using stochastic-control methodologies, offering optimal solutions that address model uncertainty, social costs of carbon, and a wide variety of adaptation actions.

This repository contains the steps along with the necessary codes for generating components of the MDP and POMDP models for flood management and for generating the input
for dynamic programming solvers like FRTDP.
